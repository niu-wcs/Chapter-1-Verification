# control.txt
# Parameter file for the wrf-run script
#  Information:
#   Lines that begin with a '#' are comment lines and are ignored
#   All other lines will store a variable under the name of the first word, with the value of the second
#    EX: myVariable 12
#    Would store the parameter myVariable as 12
#   All remaining information following the second block is ignored, allowing for comments to be used
#    EX: myVariable 12 This is a sample variable
#    This is also an acceptable format for this file
#
#   You can also define some parameters as a "list" of variables, to do so:
#    myVariable {1,2,3,4,5}
#   You can force an integer or float transformation on it by prepending a statement:
#    myVariable (int){1,2,3,4,5}
