Anaconda Python Environment

Instructions to create should the need to re-install happen

The order here is VERY IMPORTANT to prevent dependency issues

conda create -n wrf-work python=3.9
conda activate wrf-work
conda install -c conda-forge xesmf geopandas
conda install -c conda-forge wrf-python metpy netCDF4
conda install matplotlib

conda remove mpi4py mpich mpi
MPICC="mpicc -shared" pip install --no-cache-dir --no-binary=mpi4py mpi4py
pip install cdsapi
pip install geojsoncontour


I highly recommend to fully test all packages in a standard python call once done:

python 

Once in the python instance, run the following import commands to verify the installation:

import geopandas as gpd
import xesmf as xe
import geojsoncontour

from mpi4py import MPI as _MPI 
(NOTE: This last import may fail, but if it does so in a manner that makes it look like you ran a MPI task that 
aborted with an error code 0 or 1, then your MPI built correctly and you are good to go!)

Finally, edit the bottom of the .bashrc file to add in:

conda activate wrf-work

This will ensure the environment variables for ESMPY and XESMF are properly set in any job scripts.
